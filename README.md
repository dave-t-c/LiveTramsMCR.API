## Introduction
C# ASP.NET API to retrieve live service data from TfGM Open Data API and adds more detailed stop information.

This API is used in the [LiveTramsMCR](https://github.com/dave-t-c/LiveTramsMCR) app.

## Running the system locally
To run the system locally, you will need docker and docker-compose installed.

First, add your `TfGM OcpApimSubscriptionKey` key into the `docker-compose.run-local.yaml` file.

After doing this, run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.run-local.yml up -d` from the route repo directory.

This will start the system locally on `localhost:8080`. Head to `localhost:8080/swagger/index.html` to view endpoints.

You will also be able to view any changes you make to data using
mongo express, which will be started on `localhost:8081`. This can be accessed using the default mentioned `ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_USERNAME` username and `ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_PASSWORD` password specified [here](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express?tab=readme-ov-file#usage-docker).
You can also do this for the dynamodb data by instead going to `localhost:8001`.

## Coming soon
- Expected journey time and stops for route planning
- Ticketing prices for a given journey

## Project Goals
- Create a wrapper for the TfGM API that adds additional data
- Create a route planning system
- Gain experience using ASP.NET
- Create a project using Azure

## Project Status
The project currently features:
- Detailed stop information
- Live service data for stops ordered by destination
